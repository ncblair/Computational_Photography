		<h1>Project 2: Building a Pinhole Camera</h1>
		<h2>Toby Chen, Nathan Blair, CS194-26</h2>
		<p>
			We used a cardboard box, some paper, tape, and a gopro to create a pinhole camera.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is what our camera looks like. All images were taken with a 5 second long exposure from the gopro sitting inside of the box. The pictures it takes are upsidedown, so we flipped them.

			We took images with a .1 mm pinhole. These were dark, but sharp.

			We took images with a 3 mm pinhole. These were brighter, but a little bit blurrier.

			We took images with a 5 mm pinhold. These were very bright, but also very blurry.

            Our best pinhole size was 3mm. Here are some more pictures.
